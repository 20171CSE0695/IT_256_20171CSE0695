In 2005, at the age of 15, she played the female lead in Chand Sa Roshan Chehra, which was a commercial failure at the box office.[13] The same year, she made her debut in Telugu cinema with Sri and in Tamil cinema with Kedi in 2006. IndiaGlitz in its review called Tamannaah the "real scene-stealer" and stated that she "walks away with all honors", adding that her characters have shades of the characters played by Vijayashanti in Mannan (1992) and Ramya Krishnan in Padayappa (1999).[14]

Her first release of 2007 was Shakti Chidambaram's Viyabari, in which she played the role of a journalist who wants to write an article about a successful entrepreneur played by S. J. Suryah. The film opened to negative reviews and flopped at the box office,[15] but Tamannaah received praise for her performance.[16] She got her breakthrough with Sekhar Kammula's Happy Days and Balaji Sakthivel's Kalloori, both of which featured Tamannaah as a college student. She won critical acclaim for her performances in both films.[17] The commercial success of Happy Days and Kalloori established her career as an actress in both Telugu and Tamil films.[18] Her performance in the latter earned her a nomination at the 56th Filmfare Awards South in the Best Tamil Actress category.[19]

Her first release of 2008 was the Telugu film Kalidasu, directed by debutante G. Ravicharan Reddy. She was paired with debutante Sushanth, the grandson of actor Akkineni Nageswara Rao.[17] Upon release, the film opened to moderate reviews and critics felt that she looked good and very romantic, but had less scope to perform.[20][21][22] The film was an average grosser at the box office.[23] She later made a cameo appearance in the Telugu film Ready, followed by another cameo appearance in the Telugu - Tamil bilingual Ninna Nedu Repu, titled Netru Indru Naalai in Tamil.[24]

Tamannaah's first release of 2009 was the Tamil film Padikkadavan, directed by Suraj and co-starring Dhanush, which was named after Rajinikanth's 1985 film of the same name.

The film received positive reviews from critics and she received critical acclaim for her performance,[28][29] earning a nomination at the 57th Filmfare Awards South in the Best Telugu Actress category.[30] The film, however, was an average grosser at the box office.[31] Her next release, K.

Anand's Ayan, co-starring Suriya, became the only major commercially successful Tamil film of the year.[32][33] She later appeared in Gandhi Krishna's Ananda Thandavam, which was based on the novel Pirivom Santhippom serialised by Sujatha Rangarajan. She was paired with Siddharth Venugopal in the film, marking the latter's debut.[34] The film opened to negative reviews,[35][36] and was her only commercial failure in 2009.[37] However, Tamannaah's performance was critically acclaimed. Pavithra Srinivasan of Rediff.com stated that Tamannaah's "would-be innocence when she's playing up to Sidharth, and slight cunning when she chooses Radhakrishnan is perfect" adding that she brought her character Madhumitha "to life, an alluring mix of child and woman; irritating, sly, yet arousing your sympathy in the climax".[38]

Tamannaah later appeared in R. Kannan's Kanden Kadhalai, the official remake of Jab We Met (2007), co-starring Bharath. Her voice was dubbed by playback singer Chinmayi.[39] Kanden Kadhalai opened to decent feedback from critics and Tamannaah's performance won praise from them.[40][41] A reviewer from Sify stated: "Funny and full of life, it is Tamannaah who is the heart and soul of this love story. She has come up with a live wire performance and the magic of the film lies in her performance", adding that no actress in Tamil cinema could play that role better than her though she did not look like a Thevar girl hailing from Theni.[42] Her performance in the film earned her a nomination at the 57th Filmfare Awards South in the Best Tamil Actress category, making her the only actress to earn two nominations in two different languages at that event.[30] She also won the South Scope award for the same.[43] During this phase, she was established as an undisputed top actress in Tamil cinema.[7][37]

P. Rajkumar's Sura, co-starring Vijay and M. Raja's Thillalangadi, co-starring Jayam Ravi, the former being Vijay's 50th film as an actor[47] and the latter being the official remake of Surender Reddy's Kick (2009).[48] Both the films flopped at the box office.[49]

Tamannaah's first release of 2011 was Siva's Siruthai, co-starring Karthi, which was the official remake of S. S. Rajamouli's Vikramarkudu (2006).[50] Her character was received poorly by critics, with Pavithra Srinivasan of Rediff.com citing that she offered "little more than arm-candy".[51] The film, however, was commercially successful.[52] She followed it with a cameo appearance in the song "Aga Naga" from K. V. Anand's Ko.[53]

She made her comeback to Telugu cinema after a two-year gap in the same year with Sukumar's 100% Love, co-starring Naga Chaitanya, in which she played the role of a village girl visiting her cousin's house in Hyderabad for pursuing higher education.[54] She won praise for her performance from the critics. A reviewer from IndiaGlitz stated that Tamannaah "stole the show in the film" and "doesn't over act or underplay her role anywhere". The reviewer added that she "is drop dead gorgeous and steals your heart with her beauty" and "wins on two counts-one is her endearing action and two is her insanely adorable looks".[55] The film became one of the biggest commercial successful Telugu films of 2011.[56] She earned a nomination each at the 59th Filmfare Awards South and 1st South Indian International Movie Awards in the Best Telugu Actress category.[57] She also won the Best Actor Female awards at CineMAA Awards 2012 and The Hyderabad Times Film Awards 2011.[58][59] Her next release of 2011 was V. V. Vinayak's Badrinath, co-starring Allu Arjun. Her looks in the film became debatable considering her girl-next-door looks sported in her previous films.[60] The film received mixed to negative reviews from critics. Suresh Kavirayani of The Times of India felt that Tamannaah was "energetic, but there was unnecessary skin show even in scenes that didn't seem to require it".[61] However, the film became a notable success at the box office.[62] She earned a nomination at the CineMAA Awards 2012 in the Best Actor Female category.[63]

She played the role of a village girl in Hari's Venghai, co-starring Dhanush, whom she called a "subtle and underplayed" character.[64] Both the film and her performance opened to mixed reviews from critics,[65][66] with Pavithra Srinivasan of Rediff.com stating that Tamannaah "appears neatly attired in classy dresses but suddenly takes to wearing skimpy clothes that display her midriff" and looks "so dazzlingly white that you want to reach for your sun-glasses".[67] Her next release Oosaravelli, co-starring N. T. Rama Rao Jr. and directed by Surender Reddy, opened to mixed reviews from critics,[68][69] and was a commercial failure.[70]

Tamannaah starred in four Telugu films in 2012, the first one being Sampath Nandi's Racha, co-starring Ram Charan, in which she played the role of a rich girl living in a protected world whose character's layers are revealed as the film progresses.[71] Upon release, Tamannaah received praise from the critics with Sify's reviewer calling her the film's "major asset",[72] and Karthik Pasupulate of The Times of India stating that she "does the needful" and "does add more than glamour value to the film".[73] The film was declared a major commercial success by the end of its 50-day run.[74] She earned a nomination each at 60th Filmfare Awards South and CineMAA Awards 2013 in the Best Actor Female category.[75][76]

Her next release, A. Karunakaran's Endukante... Premanta!, co-starring Ram, opened to negative reviews and was a commercial failure.[77] However, critics praised hers and Ram's performance in the film, with Y. Sunita Chowdary of The Hindu stating that they have "done their best to bring some semblance of reality to this fantasy",[78] and Radhika Rajamani of Rediff.com calling them the film's "heart and soul".[79] Her third release, Raghava Lawrence's Rebel, co-starring Prabhas, in which she played a hip hop dance teacher,[80] opened to mixed reviews and was a commercial failure and escalation of budget was cited as one of the primary reasons.[81] Her last release of 2012 was Puri Jagannadh's Cameraman Gangatho Rambabu, co-starring Pawan Kalyan, in which she played the role of a tomboyish media cameraman.[82] The film was one of the biggest commercial successful Telugu films of 2012.[83]
